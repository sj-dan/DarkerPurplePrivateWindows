## Requirements
- Firefox 67+

## Permissions
- Theme
- Storage

## Download
As much as I'd love to provide a download, Firefox forces developers to sign their extensions with a proprietary signing service, which is the only way to have the extension run on stable release versions of Firefox.

Since I don't plan on signing this anytime soon, you're free to [sign it yourself](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox) (it doesn't cost anything), or use Firefox Developer Edition / Firefox ESR if you really like this theme.
